### <a name="ingest"></a>Data ingest

This project works with GeoJSON files generated by the [NYPL Map Vectorizer]. The specific files for the NYPL use case are found in the [/public/files](public/files/) folder.

#### First ingest

After downloading, and running the proper `rake db:migrate` you need to do a base ingest of data using the included rake task.

####All sheet data ingest

`rake data_import:ingest_bulk id=LAYERID force=true`

This assumes the presence of `public/files/config-ingest-LAYERID.json` with a list of IDs and bounding boxes to import for the layer `LAYERID`. This **erases all sheet/polygon/flag data** for those IDs in the config file.

####Add bulk centroids

The original GeoJSON files do not have centroids (they were added and processed later). To create the centroids of the polygons in the database you need to run:

`rake data_import:ingest_centroid_bulk id=LAYERID force=true`

####Single sheet data ingest

`rake data_import:ingest_geojson id=SOMEID layer_id=SOMELAYERID bbox=SOMEBOUNDINGBOX force=true`

This imports polygons from a file `public/files/SOMEID-traced.json` into the database **replacing** any polygons (and its corresponding flags) that are associated to ID `SOMEID`.

**NOTE:** So far only layers 859 and 860 are provided. Layer 859 has separate GeoJSON for centroids and polygons. Layer 860 sheets have a single file with both fields. Ingesting 859 requires a separate `data_import:ingest_centroid_bulk` process for centroids.

### <a name="api"></a>API querying

The following API endpoints have been added to export the inspection consensus process (paginated by groups of 500). Consensus is defined by **agreement of 75% or more of three or more votes**:

#### Polygon export → /api/polygons/…

Active endpoints:
````
/api/polygons/:task/page/:page
/api/polygons/:task/:consensus/page/:page
````

Accept tasks:
`geometry`, `color`, `polygonfix`, `address` with numeric paging (500 records per page).

`consensus` values depend on the task and perhaps only useful in the `geometry` and `color` tasks.

- `/api/polygons/geometry/page/PAGENUMBER` returns all polygons in `PAGENUMBER` regardless of their consensus value.
- `/api/polygons/geometry/yes/page/PAGENUMBER` returns all polygons in `PAGENUMBER` that have been marked as *correct*.
- `/api/polygons/geometry/no/page/PAGENUMBER` returns all polygons in `PAGENUMBER` that have been marked as *not buildings*.
- `/api/polygons/geometry/fix/page/PAGENUMBER` returns all polygons in `PAGENUMBER` that need to be *fixed*.

### Version notes

- 2.0 Second release with `address`, `polygonfix` and `color` tasks. Refactored and improved code. New API endpoints.
- 1.1 Added API endpoints
- 1.0 First release with single `geometry` task
